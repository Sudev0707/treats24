generate an OTP, send it to phone (SMS) or email:
(verify it in React Native, you need a backend service + server-side OTP logic. React Native cannot send SMS or email directly)

1 — Phone OTP using Firebase Authentication
    npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth


2 — Send OTP via Email (Node.js Backend / Java Mail)

3 — SMS OTP Without Firebase (Twilio / MSG91 / Fast2SMS)
